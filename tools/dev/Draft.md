First: Generate a new document with your WHOLE last response. Second: Append this very prompt to the end of the new document you create.Then, the answers to your questions: Q1) At deployment root; Q2) New Pulumi State Management structure approved; Q3) Option A - But be very mindful not to introduce new inconsistencies. Keep as much of the original documentation as possible. Do not remove sections or information. Only change what is needed. But change everything that is necessary.Be extremely through. Think deep, wide and well before creating each of the documents and review and cross reference them before moving to the next one. Make sure all diagrams are correct. Make sure all naming is correct. Make sure there are no inconsistencies; Q4) Not aware of other discrepancies and no other changes at the moment. Now, after your questions have been answered, you may proceed with the implementation plan (creating all v.3.1 docs) - approved. Go!

==
# Task 1: Verify one more time, all documents, looking for incompleteness or inconsistencies inside the document and also, cross-referencing the documents and making sure there are no inconsistencies between document. Verify the differences between v3.0 and v3.1 are only the necessary changes we requested. Verify and confirm that all sections in v3.0 are present in v3.1. 

# Task 2: Create updated versions odf the documents Session-2.Prompt.md and Session-3-Prompt.md, reflecting changes in the version of document names (v3.1, instead of v.3.0) and possibly, reflecting the architecture adjusments it has been made for version 3.1.

# Task 3: Answer the following questions: A) Anything else needed for total implementation? B) How should we start the implementation session (implementation of the whole architecture), using the document Session-2-Prommpt.md? Before I start, I will adjust CLAUDE.md to read the v3.1 documents, instead of the v3.0. What else should I do?

# Task 4: In the last request, there were several issues related to opened files, editing files and also running python scripts. Can these issues be anticipated and have a pre-plan, so they dont reoccur?

# Task 5: Save all these answers to a new document.

Line 576: Wrong path: "cloud/templates/mainfest/custom" - a) manifest should not exist; b) custom is under manifest.

Line 779 and others: Stacks are missing the docs subdirectory

Line 816: Manifest is under src. It should be under root already!!!

Read all tasks below, before starting to execute them.

The following is all related to the contents of Session-2-Prompt.3.1.md

# Task 1 - Prompt-12 document
    - Is "Prompt-12 - Implement Final Version.md" really necessary?
    - It has several references to Arch v2.3, which is outdated.
    - But it has a list of tasks (5.1-5.10) that should be executed on Session 2.
    - Maybe the tasks in the Prompt-12 document, can be adjusted and incorporated to the new Session 2 document (see below)?
    - What do you recommend?

# Task 2: Create a new Session 2 document that is more clear, but keeping its completeness. 
    - What do you think?
    - Show unnecessary tasks that have been complete already and should not be repeated.
    - Make sure all sections from original Session2-v3.1 are present.
    - Make sure all relevant tasks from Prompt-12 are present.
    - We dont want to risk not implementing some features.
    - Cross-check. Througly.,

# Task 3: Path inconsistency

    - I found one path inconsistency on Line 265. Become aware of this.
    - Check for other inconsistencies in paths, versions, document locations.
    - Report and adjust in the new Session-2 document.

Line 237: it seems index.ts is inside src - while the Directory_Structure_Diagram.3.1.md (which is authoritative), indicates differently. Fix Session-2-Prompt.3.1.IMPROVED

Line 357: Task 5.4.2: Check for destination paths, according to Directory_Structure_Diagram.3.1.md

Line 442: Task 4.4.2: It seems the directory structure for the CLI code is different from the Directory_Structure_Diagram.3.1.md. Think deep which directory structure is better for the cli - maybe a mix of what each document describes. Think deep about this, as this CLI will be critical to the architecture and its maintenance and grow will be highly important.

UPDATE Session-2-Prompt.3.1.IMPROVED to use Python for the CLI - Maybve create a new Session-2 document, with the fixes forr the issues above and the new python requirement. - call it Session-2.1.md

**In the new session, your first message should be:**

I want to implement Architecture 3.1 (Session 2 - Core Implementation).  
Please read: cloud/.claude/CLAUDE.md for project context.
Please read and execute: cloud/.claude/memory/Session-2.1.md
Ready to start implementation. Proceed.

Answer - Just answer the following questions:

1 - Why are you not finishing the tasks completely, as instructed?
1.1 - Every time, we have to repeat the instructions and waste time with additional, unnecessary prompts, because you are being too lazy, not completing the tasks and wrongly announcing them as complete. This keeps recurring in all asessions. 
    - Why is it happening in the first place?
    - Why it keeps re-occuring?
2 - In the last session:
    - There were plenty of tokens leftplenty of tokens left
    - A very clear list of tasks to execute - which included to FINISH the CLI ENTIRELY!!!
    - An execution plan
    - User review and approval!!
    2.1 - So what is your excuse for being lazy and not finishing the CLI?
    2.2 - Who gave you authorization to move part of the CLI development to Session 4? What a stupid idea!!!
3 - What do you suggest me to do, to GUARANTEE that you are never this lazy and rogue again?
4 - Save your answers, excuses and promises to a new document.
