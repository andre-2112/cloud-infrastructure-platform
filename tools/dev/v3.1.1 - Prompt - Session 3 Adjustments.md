# Tasks

Unless stated otherwise, all new documents to be saved in the cloud/dev folder.

## Task 1 - Document install

    1.1 - Create a new directory: cloud/tools/install.
    
    1.2 - Move the installation scripts you created, to this new directory.

    1.3 - As the location of the scripts above changed, adjust the scripts or their invocation, as necessary for them to work.
    
    1.4 - Create a new INSTALL.md document, under cloud/tools/docs, instructing how to: 
    
        - How to build a single pulumi stack; 
        - How to build all pulumi stacks at once; 
        - How to uild the CLI; 
        - How to test and run the CLI. 
        
    1.5 - Create a new README.md document, under cloud/tools/docs, containing a master index document, listing all documents in the cloud/.claude/CLAUDE.md file, plus the new INSTALL.md document, you were instructed above to create.

## Task 2 - Adjust Session-Prompt-3.1.md

    2.1 - According to the Session planning in Execution_Feasibility_Analysis.md and other documents, Session 2 (Session-2.1.md) should have delivered a complete core implementation, which should include a complete CLI. Somehow it only delivered the platform structure and it did not deliver the complete CLI. We will fix that below but I want to bring this shortsight to your attention. 

    2.2 - Originally, Session 3 (Session-Prompt-3.1.md) should focus on REST API, WebSocket Monitoring and Database Integration. But due to the unfinished implementation of the CLI, reported above, we will adjust Session 3 (creating a new document and calling it Session-3.1.md), to focus on finishing the CLI. And we will move REST API, WebSocket Monitoring and Database Integration, to new Session documents, as described in the next main tasks.

    2.3 - The new Session 3.1 document (Session-Prompt-3.1.md) should:

        - Use original Session 2 and Session 3 documents as references.
        - Add knowledge about the work that has been done (on Session 1 and Session 2.1) - particularly the platform foundation (including the CLI structure).
        - Think deep and plan deeply the full implementation of thee CLI.
        - Generate instructions and details to make it poossible to fully complete the implementation of CLI.
        - Verify and ensure full CLI implementation. Create testing scripts if necessary.
        - Provide information on how to test the CLI.

    2.4 - Additionally, answer the following questions, related to the common code between the CLI and future REST API:

    2.4.1 - Should we share common code between CLI and REST API? In percentage, how much of the code, do you estimate to be shared?
    
    2.4.2 - How should we maintain code? Which is authoritative, CLI or REST API - I think CLI. What can we use as a reference for REST API maintenance, based on the future changes in the CLI? Should we use some schema, architecture definition or what do you suggest to use as an authroritative referecne for all implementations? DO you have other suggestions?

    2.5 - In the tasks below we will create new Session documents and move to new Sessions the following work that originally was planned to be executed by Session 3:

    2.5.1 - Move all further planning and implementation related to REST API, to Session 4, as described on Task 3, below.

    2.5.2 - Move all further planning and implementation related to Database Integration, to Session 5, as described on Task 4, below.

    2.5.3 - Move all further planning and implementation related to WebSocket Monitoring, to Session 6, as described on Task 5, below.  

## Task 3 - Create Session 4 - REST API

    3.1 - Create a new Session-4.md document that should include detailed instructions for the execution of Session 4.

    3.1.1 - The document should acknowledge the work that has been done (or will be completed by the time Session 4 is executed), in the previous Sessions, specially the CLI.

    3.1.2 - Before generating the document, do think deep and plan even more deeply, on how to fully implement the REST API.

        - Plan to use python andd FastAPI for the REST API
        - The plan should include instructions to ensure that the REST API is fully consistent with the CLI, in terms of features and behavior. 
        - For this first version of the REST API, the service will have no authenticaiton support - it will be public.
        - Plan which additional AWS resources and services will be required by the service.

    3.1.3 - Generate a plan to implement the REST API in its entirity. 
    
        - This plan is the core of this Session 4 document.
        - The plan should include all necessary steps to implement the REST API.
        - The plan should include all necessary steps to deploy and configure the additional AWS resources and services required by the REST API service.
        - The plan should include testing instructions. 

    3.1.4 - Create an Addendum document with a detailed plan to add and implement in the future, cognito authentication for the REST API service.

        - Document the necessary changes and additon to the REST API service architecture
        - DOcument creation and connfiguration of the Cognito-related resources.
        - Document changes in the REST API service to integrate cognito authentication.
        - Document testing of the Cognito authentication integration.
        - Document usage examples of the REST API service, with authentication.

## Task 4 - Create Session 5 - Database Integration

    4.1 - Create a new Session-5.md document that should include detailed instructions for the execution of Session 5.

    4.1.2 - Before generating the document, do think deep and plan even more deeply, on how to best and fully integrate the platform with a database.

        - Plan to use python as the programming language for any integration.
        - Plan to use AWS DynamoDB as the remote database. 
        - Plan DynamoDB configuration.
        - Plan DB authentication, particualrly with AWS Cognito.
        - Plan GraphQL and the respective resolvers.
        - Consider using a smaller local database (such as SQLite), if it makes sense.
        - The plan should include instructions to ensure that any database integration is fully consistent with the CLI and REST API, in terms of features and behavior. 

    4.1.3 - Generate a plan to implement the database integration in its entirity. 
    
        - This plan is the core of this Session 5 document.
        - The plan should include all necessary steps to completely implement the DB integration.
        - The plan should include all necessary steps to deploy and configure the additional AWS resources and services required by the database integratione.

        - The plan should include all necessary steps to deploy and configure the additional AWS resources and services required by the WebSocket Monitoring architecture.
        - The plan should include testing instructions.

## Task 6 - Init prompt for session 3

    Generate the step instructions and short prompt, to instruct Claude Code to execute Session 3 and achieve its goals. 

    These instructions and prompt will be executed at the beginning of a completely new Claude Code session.
