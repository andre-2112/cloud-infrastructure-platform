# Task - Update to v.4.0, the original "Architecture documents" (v.3.1)

   <context>
      Originally, the 3 documents below have been the non-official authoritative sources for the architecture:

         - cloud/tools/docs/Multi_Stack_Architecture.3.1.md
         - cloud/tools/docs/Directory_Structure_Diagram.3.1.md
         - cloud/tools/docs/Deployment_Manifest_Specification.3.1.md

      Originally, we also have the following 2 documwents, which are semi-authoritative:

         - cloud/tools/docs/README.md
         - cloud/tools/docs/INSTALL.md

      Recently, we decided to officialize the authoritative status of some documents, by creating the list of authoritative documents (that will be kept as part of a permanent memory), and added the folowwing documents to the list:

         - cloud/tools/docs/Stack_Parameters_and_Registration_Guide_v4.md
         - cloud/tools/docs/Complete_Guide_Templates_Stacks_Config_and_Registration_v4.md
         - cloud/tools/docs/Complete_Stack_Management_Guide_v4.md
   </context> 

   Your tasks are:

   ## Task 1 
   
      Read again:

      - cloud/tools/docs/Multi_Stack_Architecture.3.1.md
      - cloud/tools/docs/Directory_Structure_Diagram.3.1.md
      - cloud/tools/docs/Deployment_Manifest_Specification.3.1.md

      - cloud/tools/docs/README.md
      - cloud/tools/docs/INSTALL.md

      - cloud/tools/docs/Stack_Parameters_and_Registration_Guide_v4.md
      - cloud/tools/docs/Complete_Guide_Templates_Stacks_Config_and_Registration_v4.md
      - cloud/tools/docs/Complete_Stack_Management_Guide_v4.md

   ## Task 2 
   
      Verify for inconsistencies in "3.1" documents, compared to the new, authoritative "v4" documents above.

   ## Task 3
      
      Verify for inconsistencies in the README and INSTALL documents, compared to the new, authoritative "v4" documents above.

   ## Task 4
         
      Think deep and think if there any other inconsistencies or need for additional authoritative documentation in the original 5 documents mentioned above.

   ## Task 5
         
      Create new v.4.1 versions of the original 5 documents, ensuring they are up to date (including flow diagrams and directory structures) and correct (this is very important). 
      
      Additionally, verify and think, if any sections should be added or expanded in these new documents; to provide valuable authoritative information - to serve as a guidelines for future implementations of the architecture and the stacks. 

      Do not subtract content. Only update, and expand (if advisable).

== 
1 - I just saw a directory in the actual file system: cloud/templates/config. it should not be there. we need to find out why and where is referred. which docs have cloud/templates?

2 - special docs authoritative for different parts of the arch:
   - overall architecture
      - main fearures
      - main components
   - stack management
   - template management
   - deployment management
   - state mamagement

==
1 - Wait on creating the template library. We will address that soon.

2 -Fix the issues. 

The current issues I am aware of (some might be redundant):

2.1 - Address pre-existing StackCodeValidator test failures
2.2 - Review and update CLI parser tests
2.3 - Deprecate {{...}} syntax in favor of ${...} for consistency
2.4 - Fix 12 test failures in stack_code_validator
2.5 - Fix CLI test import errors

Add any other issue you know.

Solve all issues.

Run ALL tests again.

==
3 - Create new docs:

   - Error_Handling_Guide_v4.1.md
   - Implementation_Examples_v4.1.md

   - Enhanced_Template_Format_Specification.4.1.md
   - Auto_Extraction_System_Guide.4.1.md

# Tasks

   - Adapt network stack to confirm with architecture v.4(.*)

## Task 1 - READ CONTEXT

   Read ALL of the documents below, one more time:

    - cloud/tools/docs/Multi_Stack_Architecture.4.1.md
    - cloud/tools/docs/Multi_Stack_Architecture_4.1_Update_Specification.md

    - cloud/tools/docs/Directory_Structure_Diagram.4.1.md
    - cloud/tools/docs/Deployment_Manifest_Specification.4.1.md

    - cloud/tools/docs/Stack_Parameters_and_Registration_Guide_v4.md
    - cloud/tools/docs/Complete_Guide_Templates_Stacks_Config_and_Registration_v4.md
    - cloud/tools/docs/Complete_Stack_Management_Guide_v4.md

    - cloud/tools/docs/README.md
    - cloud/tools/docs/INSTALL.md
    - cloud/tools/docs/INSTALL_v4.1_additions.md

   - cloud/tools/docs/API_Reference_v4.1.md
   - cloud/tools/docs/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE_v4.1.md

## Task 2 - READ NETWORK STACK

   - Read all of the files and code inside the current network stack (cloud/stacks/network/).

   - Understand its intended functionality and the implemented functionality.

## Task 3 - THINK

   3.1 - Think and Plan what needs to be changed in the stack files and code, to become fully complient with architecture v.4.1.

   3.2 - Analyze (non-exclusively) the following:

      - directory structures
      - naming conventions
      - stack structure
      - stack registration
      - template management
      - deployment management 
      - pulumi state management
      - cross-stack dependencies

## Task 4 - IMPLEMENT

   4.1 - Generate complete new files and code to replace the old, network stack implementation.

   4.2 - Ensure that the new code:

         - Matches v.4.1 architecture.
         - Will create the intended AWS resources, when the code is ran via the "cloud" CLI tool.
         - Will generated the expected output, when the code is ran via the "cloud" CLI tool.

## Task 5 - REGISTER

   - Register the new "network" stack.

## Task 6 - PREPARE

   Create a "live", test deployment with:
      - Only "network" stack enabled.
      - Only "dev" environment enabled.

## Task 7 - EXECUTE

   - Execute the live test deployment.

   - Verify the planned AWS resources were created.

## Task 8 - REPORT

   - Write a short report document.

==
Before you proceed i want you to verify something:

I think the Multi_Stack_Architecture.4.1.md:1281-1293 document is wrong, regarding the stack directory structure.

1 - Check:

    - cloud/tools/docs/Directory_Structure_Diagram.4.1.md
    - cloud/tools/docs/Complete_Stack_Management_Guide_v4.md

2 - Correct Multi_Stack_Architecture.4.1.md

After that verification and possible correction, you may proceed with the Implementation, and generate the v4.1-compliant network stack code and enhanced template as planned; with the necessary adjustments (to comply with the authoritative Directory_Structure_Diagram.4.1.md), if necessary.

==
# Tasks

## Task 1

   - Did you use the CLI tool to create the deplyment and deploy? if NO, explain why. 

## Task 2 

   - Can you use the cli tool to destroy all of the aws resources created in the live test deplyment? Execute and confirm those resources (and ONLY those resources) were destroyed

## Task 3 

   - Then, do another live test deployment, for the network stack, using the CLI tool to create the deployment and to actually deply it and check its status.

## Task 4 

   - Lastly, to run the CLI tool, do we invoke it by calling "cloud" or "cloud_cli"? We want just "cloud"; what needs to be changed in the implementation and possibly, documents?

## Task 5 

   - Save the whole reposnse from the tasks above, under a new report document - for Test 2 of Network Stack - v.4.1. 
   
   - Lets start saving all of the execution report documents and version them.

==

Make a plan and save it as a markdown document(maybe to be executed in a new session - so include references to contextual document), to implement all of the Recommendations from the Network_Stack_Test_2_Report_v4.1.md document (Exerpt below). Execute the plan after its documented.

   <snippet>
      ## Recommendations

      ### Immediate (Critical)

      1. **Audit All CLI Commands**
         - Check every command file for same issues
         - Verify method names match core library
         - Verify parameter signatures
         - Verify return type handling

      2. **Add Integration Tests**
         - Create `tests/integration/` suite
         - Test CLI → Core method calls
         - Mock Pulumi/AWS for speed
         - Run in CI/CD

      3. **CLI Smoke Tests**
         - Test each command help text
         - Test each command with dry-run
         - Verify manifest validation
         - Verify error handling

      ### Short-term (Important)

      4. **Update Documentation**
         - Document actual CLI command usage
         - Show installation process
         - Update examples with `cloud` command
         - Document v4.1 manifest format in CLI docs

      5. **Version Alignment**
         - Ensure CLI docs reference v4.1
         - Remove v3.1 references
         - Update CLI help text versions

      ### Long-term (Quality)

      6. **Type Checking**
         - Enable mypy for CLI commands
         - Add type hints to all functions
         - CI/CD type check enforcement

      7. **API Contracts**
         - Define interfaces for core library
         - Use protocols/abstract classes
         - Detect breaking changes automatically

===

1 - Implement the following Recommendations from CLI_Audit_Report_v4.1.md:

   <recommendatiions>
      ### Immediate (Critical)
      1. ✅ Complete audit of all 13 commands (DONE)
      2. ⏳ Fix deploy_cmd.py (5 issues)
      3. ⏳ Fix destroy_cmd.py (1 issue)
      4. ⏳ Test fixes with preview/dry-run modes
      5. ⏳ Full integration test

      ### Short-term (Important)
      6. Add smoke tests for all 13 commands
      7. Add integration tests for deploy/destroy workflows
      8. Document correct API usage patterns
      9. Add pre-commit hooks for API signature validation
   </recommendatiions>

2 - Implement Phases 1, 2 and 3 of from CLI_v4.1_Integration_Fix_Plan.md

==
## Installation

```bash
# Install from source
cd cloud/tools/cli
pip install -e .

# Verify installation
cloud --version  # Should show 4.1.x
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Initialize deployment
cloud init --template fullstack

# Deploy a single stack
cloud deploy-stack DTEST01 network --environment dev

# Check status
cloud status DTEST01 --environment dev

# Destroy stack
cloud destroy-stack DTEST01 network --environment dev --yes
```

==
# Question 1: Which templates you needed but could not find and had to create?

# Question 2: Isn't the Deplyment ID automaticly generated if not passed to the "cloud init" command?

# Question 3:
   why are you using the following command:
      "python -m cloud_cli.main status status DTEST01 --environment dev"
   instead of something like:
      "cloud status DTEST01 --environment dev"

# Tasks 

Proceed with Remaining Work - immediately

## Task 1 - **cloud_core Investigation Needed**
   - Why does DeploymentManager return None?
   - Path discovery mechanism needs review
   - Configuration/environment setup required

## Task 2 - **Full Integration Test Blocked**
   - Cannot test actual deployment flow
   - Cannot test destroy workflow
   - Requires cloud_core fix first

==
```bash
cd cloud/tools/cli
python -m cloud_cli.main deploy-stack deploy-stack DTEST02 network --environment dev --preview
```

python -m cloud_cli.main status status DTEST01 --environment dev

Bash(cd cloud && python -m cloud_cli.main init init --org CLITestOrg --project        
      cli-live-test --domain clitest.example.com --account-dev 123456789012 --template  
      defau…)
  ⎿  Generated deployment ID: DWXE7BR

==
1 - if you needed to update the pulumiOrg to andre-2112, then you should ensure any template that has been set to pulumiOrg is fixed.

2 - no live-test-5 and 2 live-test-6? why? how did that happen? explain and if necessary, fix.

3 - i saw in deplyment logs the following: "pulumi stack rm andre-2112/network/DWXE7BR-network-dev"

3.1 - is that how the architecture defined the pulumi stack names?

3.2 - show me the section in the architecture documents , that talk about the pulumi stack naming.

4 - why "cloud list" is showing 4 deployments as initialized and not "deployed"?

==
1 - save the status explanation to a short new addendum document under the current arch version.

2 - regarding the pulumi stack name, the implemented code *might* be wrong (but could be right too).
i remember seeing in the documentation, the naming convention we had chosen.
during the discussions about org names, porject names at deplyment level and pulumi stack level.
look at the arch v.3.1 doc or stack configuration and management docs for v3.1 and v4.
search every doc in the tools/docs if necessary.

==

1 - destroy all current deployments. wait until all related aws resources are cleaned up.

2 - delete all deployment directories (under cloud/deploy). we will start fresh.

3 - fix the code related to the pulumi naming convention - make it conform wiht the planned architecture.

4 - create a new live test deployment - for network stack, for dev environment. live-test-1. deploy it using the cli.

==
Option 3. dynamically generate pulumi.yaml. the other options are really not      
  good. but make a detailed implementation plan first and document it -      
  including the dynamic Pulumi.yaml logic. add the last response to the      
  document, documenting the reasons for the dynamic pulumi.yaml. then        
  execute the implementation plan. set organization for all tests
  (template) to "TestOrg" and the project to "TestProj". then make 2 test    
  deployments.  

==
1 - Disable all stacks, by default, in the templates.

2 - Add the dynamic Pulumi.yaml solution to the authoritative Architecture documents (whenever its related to the document), creating new documents, complete from v4 or 4.1 (do not remove document sections - only adjust or add); but use version 4.5 now. The new architecture version will be known as Architecture 4.5 (or just Arch.4.5).

==
search for same path issues in all commands. fix them.

Option 3: create pulumi.yaml in the deployment dir and cp to stack dir during deployment.

==
# Question 1 

    <exerpt>
        Remaining Issue:

        The ConfigGenerator is creating config files with the wrong      
        prefix. It uses stack_name: (e.g., network:) but should use      
        the project name from the manifest (e.g., demo-test:) because    
        of the dynamic Pulumi.yaml management that changes the
        project name during deployment.

        Next Steps:

        We need to fix config_generator.py line 100-130 to use
        manifest.get("project", "") instead of stack_name as the
        config key prefix. This is a critical fix for the
        --config-file approach to work correctly.
    </exerpt>

    Is config_generator currently being used for stack configuration or deployment configuration?

# Question 2

    Explain the lifecycle and the relationship between:

        - stack template.
        - deployment config.
        - Pulumi.yaml inside the stacks.
        - Pulumi.<deplyment-id>-<stack>-<environmenmt>.yaml inside the deployment directory.
        - Especially the relationship between deplyment config and Pulumi.<deplyment-id>-<stack>-<environmenmt>.yaml inside the deployment directory.

# Question 3

    I see multiple pulumi yaml inside the stacks.

        3.1 - why are they there?

        3.2 - Is the cloud tool creating deployment yamls (Pulumi.<deplyment-id>-<stack>-<environmenmt>.yaml) *inside** the stack directory? I understand it might be necessary, but maybe it should be created in the deplyment directory and only exist temporarily inside the stack?

        3.3 - In the case above, it just needs to be cleaned-up?

# Question 4

    If there is no better solution and we need to continue with the Dynamic Pulumi YAML inside the stack, then:

    - The implementation should have always only one pulumi yaml inside the stack. Do we need more?
    - The implementation should generate the pulumi.yaml in the deployment directory
    - The implementation should copy the pulumi.yaml from the deplyment directory to the stack directory during deployment.
    - The implementation should cleanup the stack directory after deployment.

# Question 5 

    Correct me if i am making wrong assumptions or I am getting confused somehow, but:

    Does Pulumi Cloud require the stack name to match the project name not only on deployment but also on destroy?

# Question 6

    To make sure:
    - pulumiOrg is not the is not the same as organization.
    - So in the pulumi cloud, there is not reference of the true organization, in the current naming.

# Question 7

    Propose alternative naming schemes for Pulumi Cloud, regarding pulumiorg, Project and Stack options that ensure:
        - The existence of a single copy of each stack at all given moments.
        - Deployments should have only and all information related to the deployment of stacks, for their particular environmants, projects and organizations.
        - Stacks shouyld only contain information for the execution of the stack. I understand that a deplyment need the stack directory for the execution.

# Comment:

    If Pulumi Cloud really requires that at the deplyment level, the highest level entity is pulumiOrg (and that is tied to the pulumi cloud account - not the organization related to the particular deplyment), and the second level is project (which MUST match the stack name - are we effectively bypassing this requirement?), then maybe we should be embedding the organijation name and project name into the stack name?

    <exemple>
        andre-2112/
        ├── network/
        │   ├── DTEST03-TestOrg-TestProj-network-dev (0 resources, destroyed)
        │   ├── DTEST03-TestOrg-TestProj-network-prod (0 resources, destroyed)
        │   ├── DWXE7BR-TestOrg-Project2-network-dev (0 resources, destroyed)
        │   ├── D123456-OtherOrg-Project54-network-dev (0 resources, destroyed)
        │   └── ... (all destroyed)
        ├── security/
        └── ...
    </exemple>

    Does that mean that if we have hundreds of organizations, with dozens of projects and dozens of stacks, we will end up with hundreds (or even thousands) of deplyment entries under each stack (such as the ones above)? its too much cluttering and terrible grouping.

    Find me a better way for grouping in the Pulumi Cloud, with the given constrains.

==
1 - We will proceed with my suggestion: {DeploymentID}-{Organization}-{Project}

2 - Ensure that whatever pending bugs related to this subject (config_generator?), are fixed.

3 - Ensure the solution works for all commands - not only deply and destroy.

4 - If non-default temporary Pulumi files must exist inside the stack:

4.1 - Ensure they are created in the deployment directory (and this will be the authrotitative copy) and only a copy of it is temporarily moved to the stack directory.

4.2 - Ensure they only exist for the duration needed for the stack execution, and not more.

4.3 - Ensure they are properly cleaned-up after they are needed.

4.4 - If we find lingering files later and manually clean them up later, that no bad side effects will happen (example: preventing cloud <command> to run.

4.5 - Ensure proper logging of the creation, copying and deletion of these temporary files.

==
1 - why did we get that deploy_stack_command error? i want no errors!

2 - why are you doing a PATH export every time? cant this cloud path execution issues be dealt with at the beginning of the install and be done with it - only invoke the cloud command and that is all? whatever the sulution, we also need to umdate the INSTALL document for that - have we done that already?

3 - if you find errors, dont destroy the deployment - use it to investigate and fix the root of the issue.

4 - after you answer the questions (and possibly make any corrections), do another test deployment, only for the network stack on dev environment - hopefully wiht no errors. do not destroy the deployment after the test. i will want ot use the cloud status command later, to check on the deployment.

==
The INSTALL.md is already updated (lines 417-486)

1 - Fix the Unicode error once and for all: Replace Unicode characters with ASCII equivalents or handle
  UnicodeEncodeError gracefully.

2 - Proactively think and fix similar unicode issues in other cloud commands that already have been implemented.

3 - Is "cd cloud" required? i would like to type the "cloud" command from any directory.  
  deploy a 5th deplyment - for network stack only and for dev environment. i want to    
  see 2 concurrent deployments with cloud status.

4 - And why "cloud init init" and "cloud status status"? why the repetition?

==
OMG: cloud init / cloud list / cloud status / cloud destroy

1 - What do you mean register commands? what kind of command registration? is it necessary or are there other alternatives? we should be able to just run "cloud" from any directory - but the installation should be as simp;le as possible and work on any OS (mac/linux, windows).

2 - cloud status - it says: Erro: missing command. why?

==
1 - Make sure the following below is applied to all commands - i dont want unicode errors on other cloud commands. And fix the any and all template path issues. then test some other command to see if unicode issues are still present (pick a command that would encounter the unicode issue). then, run another concurrent deployment as yet another deplyment test.

<exerpt>
"cd cloud" Requirement Removed

  Created cloud/tools/cli/src/cloud_cli/utils/path_utils.py      
  with:
  - find_cloud_root() - Searches for cloud directory
  automatically
  - get_stacks_dir(), get_deploy_dir(), get_tools_dir()
  helpers

  Applied to: deploy_stack_cmd.py and destroy_stack_cmd.py       
  (line 110 & 102 respectively)

  Now works from ANY directory (tested from /tmp)

  Note: Template paths still need fixing (TemplateManager        
  uses Path.cwd()) - this is tracked for future work but
  doesn't block normal operations.
</exerpt>

==
Deployment directories should remain even after resources have been destroyed.
How to flag fully destroyed or partially destroyed?

Add deplyment preservation policy to Architecture docs

  📋 Deployment Status Values (Defined)

  - initialized - Created but never deployed
  - deploying - Deployment in progress
  - deployed - Active with resources
  - deploy_failed - Deployment attempt failed
  - destroying - Destroy in progress
  - destroyed - Resources removed but history preserved ✅
  - destroy_failed - Destroy attempt failed
  - archived - Manually marked as archived

  🎯 Policy Benefits

  1. Audit Trail - Complete history of all deployments
  2. Compliance - Never lose deployment records
  3. Debugging - Review past deployments and failures
  4. Metrics - Track deployment patterns and costs
  5. Documentation - Built-in deployment notes field

  The cloud list list command now correctly shows the destroyed status, preserving      
  the deployment history while clearly indicating it's no longer active! 🎉

==
1 - Add a short new section (think and find the best place to add this new section), about the "composite project naming scheme" changes, to the authoritative Architecture documents below (whenever its related to the document), creating NEW documents, COMPLETE from v4.5 (do NOT remove ANY document sections - only adjust or add); but use version 4.6 now. The new architecture version will be known as Architecture 4.6 (or just Arch.4.6).

    - cloud/tools/docs/Multi_Stack_Architecture.4.5.md (to become .4.6)

    - cloud/tools/docs/README.md - (add a 4.6 section)
    - cloud/tools/docs/INSTALL.md (add a 4.6 section)
    - cloud/tools/docs/INSTALL_v4.1_additions.md (to become INSTALL_Additions AND add a 4.6 section)

    - cloud/tools/docs/Complete_Stack_Management_Guide_v4.md (to become .4.6 instead of v4)

2 - Generate a detailed plan to create and deply an agent with the necessary knowledge and instructions to regularly update the authoritative documents. Maybe create auxiliary Claude commands to work with the agent, to achieve its goals. Create a new document for that.

==
github push
run all tests
cleanup deploy

    > 1 - Push to our github repo, everything under ./cloud,; 2 - run      
    ALL tests again; 3 - Completely cleanup the current deployment that    
    was initiated (DT28749) - cleanup everything related to it (local,    
    pulumi cloud, aws) - use pulumi cli or aws cli directly if you        
    need. 4 - absolutely do not stop until you are finished wiht all of    
    the tasks. you already have pre-approval for anything you need.       
    go!!! dont stop!! dont ask if you want me for you to 
    continmue....just continue and finish!! go!!! 

==
1 - The documention will have to be updaed to reflect the change from using --config-file to "config set". Do not do anything for now, but keep note of this change and the need to fix the docs a bit later today, when i tell you so.

2 - Are we still generating the config file, even if its not gonna be used with the --config-file parameter? are we using it to provide the "config set" parameters? are we using it for generating the temporary Pulumi.yaml stack file?

3 - In whatever relevant templates, set the following defaults values:
    org = Test Organization
    project = Test Project
    domain = genesis3d.com 
    pulumi-org = andre-2112
    account-dev = # Whatever is being used right now
    account-stage = # Whatever is being used right now
    account-prod = # Whatever is being used right now

4 - Just answer: Is interactive mode for "cloud init" already implemented?

5 - Just answer: How should the user enable stacks for deplyment currently? manually editing the Manifest? DO we have any commands already implemented to help wiht that? how long would it take to make a "cloud config <deployment-id>", with a clickable menu filled with radio buttons (is that possible in the terminal now? i think i saw a mock of that, somewhere) or some other quick, interactive interface?

==
Before we proceed with new UI...

1 - sorry, i meant pulumi_org, instead of pulumiOrg. i hope you understood mane and did NOT add a new parameter.

2 - the cli interfaces should accept spaces and special chars  in the values for "org" (organization name), and "project" (project name), but all contiguous spaces and special chars, should be replaced by a single "_" (underscore), and treat the org and project values , as such, for the rest of the framework w
orkflow (from execution, local storage, pulumi cloud, aws resources names and tags)

==
1 - Fully cleanup your test deployments.

2 - For the cli commands "cloud init/deploy/destroy": have a verbose mode (current deploy) or "short output" (pick a better mode name, make the output succint and make it the default mode when executing the command)

3 - Implement interactive mode for "cloud init".

5 - Implement interactive mode for "cloud config <deplyment-id>", to select which stacks and environments we want to deploy.

6 - Implement an interactive and rich mode for the terminal "cloud config <deplyment-id>", with a multi-colum table with stacks and multiple, clickable radio buttons to select which of them should be enabled for deployment.

7 - create an addendum document describing this new features and its implementation. this new feartures willbe part of forecoming version 4.8.

==
1 - "cloud list", reports a status of "initializing" for all deployments. can we make it so it says "deplyed" if at least one stack has been deployed? 

2 - can you enhance "cloud list" with a new --rich mode, that makes each listed Deployment-ID clickable and when you click on it, it basically executes and shows the "cloud status" for the clicked deplyment-id?

==
1 - For destroyed deployments, keep deployment directory, manifest (changed to destroyed), last state, history, logs.

    - The message "If you want to remove the stack completely, run `pulumi stack rm network-dev`" is misleading: The user should not use Pulumi commmands directly. The CLI is authoritative.

2 - Improve rich mode of cloud config

   2.1 - Configuration Options message should be shown at the bottom of the Stack Configuration screen. Right now we only see "Choice [1/2/3/4/5]:" , and its hard to remember what those option numbers refer to.

   2.1 - We should be able to select not only the stacks but also which environments we want to deply. Improve the UI/UX about this. Test it.

3 - Improve cloud list

    3.1 - Have same format and frame for default mode and --rich mode (but this mode should have the selection option at the bottom).

    3.2 - Have an option to show ALL deployments (inclusive destroyed ones) or only active deployments (initialized, pending, deployed, etc) - and this is the default.

    3.3 - Implement the possibility of invoking  status/config/deploy/destroy, for any selected deployment.

4 - Just Answer: 

    - Would it be possible to make "cloud status" to refresh periodically (updating status), similar to the utility "top"? How much effort?

# Role: You are a senior technical writer with a deep understanding of the Multi_Stack_Architecture.

# Goas: Update authoritative documents to reflect latest changes in the implementation of the architecture.

# Task:
Add a short new section to the authoritative Architecture documents below (whenever its related to the document), thinking and find the best place to add this new section; which should be about the "--config-file" vs "config set" change in the architecture's approach to how pulumi is invoked. include in the respective documents, any new commands or command parameters that have been recently added. Include these new sections by creating NEW documents, COMPLETE from v4.6 (do NOT remove ANY document sections - only adjust or add); but use version 4.8 now. The new architecture version will be known as Architecture 4.8 (or just Arch.4.8). Some of these documents are long - so plan ahead on how you will read and write them in sections. but absolutely DO NOT shorten the original content. only add content or update the related content. Do not stop until you finish ALL documents. Do not stop!! Do not stop or ask me if you should contin ue - just do it and dont stop until ALL documents are analyzed and updated where necessary.

==
1 - The --config-file vs "config set" change. 1.1 - Would this issue become moot, once we fully upgrate to Pulumi Automation API, instead of using the Pulumi CLI? 1.2 - How much of an effort to fully upgrade the currently implemented CLI to the Automation API? 1.3 -  Could we maintain the ability to use the Pulumi CLI if we want and have a CLI config setting to use Pulumi CLI or Automation API? 1.4 - DO we have a config file for the "cloud" command yet, with the various things we might want to set as a config for the CLI tool?

## Task 1 - READ BASE CONTEXT

   Read ALL of the documents below, one more time:

    - cloud/tools/docs/Multi_Stack_Architecture.4.1.md
    - cloud/tools/docs/Multi_Stack_Architecture_4.1_Update_Specification.md

    - cloud/tools/docs/Directory_Structure_Diagram.4.1.md
    - cloud/tools/docs/Deployment_Manifest_Specification.4.1.md

    - cloud/tools/docs/Stack_Parameters_and_Registration_Guide_v4.md

    - cloud/tools/docs/INSTALL_v4.1_additions.md

   - cloud/tools/docs/API_Reference_v4.1.md
   - cloud/tools/docs/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE_v4.1.md

## Task 2 - READ ADDITIONAL CONTEXT

   Read Pulumi-2\admin\v2\docs\Prompt-8-2 - NPM_WORKSPACES_IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md

## Task 3 - READ ADDITIONAL CONTEXT

Integrate it with Arch 4.1 and call it Architecture v.5.0 (or just Arch.5), which contains:
   - Everything that Architecture 4.1 has defined and implemented.
   - Add NPM Workspaces support, similar to the one described in the "Pulumi-2/admin/v2/docs/Prompt-8-2 - 
   NPM_WORKSPACES_IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md" document.
   - New CLI implementations.
   - New integration tests.

## Task 4 - READ ADDITIONAL CONTEXT

Update relevant Architecture documents - specially the authoritative documents.
   - Create v.5.0 versions of the updated documents.
   - Save the document in sections, as it might be very large.
   - Do not remove useful content. Only update the existing content or add new sections.
   - Include any carry-over sections from 3.1 that might been removed from version 4.1, due to token limits.
   - Include th integrations of NPM Workspaces in Arch v.5 (Architecture v.5.0)

- fix cli/core if necessary
- fix network stack - rm node_modules, adjust configs
- update authoritative docs

## Task 5 - READ ADDITIONAL CONTEXT

- rerun with the cli- with npm workspaces

- run all test
- test all commands - has it been done yet? make a plan - include init, status, destruction, and more

==
4 - Create network.py - need prompt
5 - Review stack pompt - ensure v4
7 - Create database-rds - from prompt
8 - Generate new prompts for most stacks
9 - Generate new python code for most stacks

==
1 - add architecture and implementation support, for aws tags for organization, project, deployment id, stack and environment; for every and all aws resources created. identify all of the aws resources cannot be tagged.

2 - propose to add a feature to enable "cloud init" to interactively ask about the organization name, as well as project name, to overide the defaults file.  perhaps a new "cloud config" command should help set these values, that should be stored in the default tmeplate or some config file.

==
cloud config for pulumi and aws credentials
how to use temporary crednetials for both?
sync local state with remote pulumi - for new cli users
