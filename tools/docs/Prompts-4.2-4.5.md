# Task - Update to v.4.0, the original "Architecture documents" (v.3.1)

   <context>
      Originally, the 3 documents below have been the non-official authoritative sources for the architecture:

         - cloud/tools/docs/Multi_Stack_Architecture.3.1.md
         - cloud/tools/docs/Directory_Structure_Diagram.3.1.md
         - cloud/tools/docs/Deployment_Manifest_Specification.3.1.md

      Originally, we also have the following 2 documwents, which are semi-authoritative:

         - cloud/tools/docs/README.md
         - cloud/tools/docs/INSTALL.md

      Recently, we decided to officialize the authoritative status of some documents, by creating the list of authoritative documents (that will be kept as part of a permanent memory), and added the folowwing documents to the list:

         - cloud/tools/docs/Stack_Parameters_and_Registration_Guide_v4.md
         - cloud/tools/docs/Complete_Guide_Templates_Stacks_Config_and_Registration_v4.md
         - cloud/tools/docs/Complete_Stack_Management_Guide_v4.md
   </context> 

   Your tasks are:

   ## Task 1 
   
      Read again:

      - cloud/tools/docs/Multi_Stack_Architecture.3.1.md
      - cloud/tools/docs/Directory_Structure_Diagram.3.1.md
      - cloud/tools/docs/Deployment_Manifest_Specification.3.1.md

      - cloud/tools/docs/README.md
      - cloud/tools/docs/INSTALL.md

      - cloud/tools/docs/Stack_Parameters_and_Registration_Guide_v4.md
      - cloud/tools/docs/Complete_Guide_Templates_Stacks_Config_and_Registration_v4.md
      - cloud/tools/docs/Complete_Stack_Management_Guide_v4.md

   ## Task 2 
   
      Verify for inconsistencies in "3.1" documents, compared to the new, authoritative "v4" documents above.

   ## Task 3
      
      Verify for inconsistencies in the README and INSTALL documents, compared to the new, authoritative "v4" documents above.

   ## Task 4
         
      Think deep and think if there any other inconsistencies or need for additional authoritative documentation in the original 5 documents mentioned above.

   ## Task 5
         
      Create new v.4.1 versions of the original 5 documents, ensuring they are up to date (including flow diagrams and directory structures) and correct (this is very important). 
      
      Additionally, verify and think, if any sections should be added or expanded in these new documents; to provide valuable authoritative information - to serve as a guidelines for future implementations of the architecture and the stacks. 

      Do not subtract content. Only update, and expand (if advisable).

== 
1 - I just saw a directory in the actual file system: cloud/templates/config. it should not be there. we need to find out why and where is referred. which docs have cloud/templates?

2 - special docs authoritative for different parts of the arch:
   - overall architecture
      - main fearures
      - main components
   - stack management
   - template management
   - deployment management
   - state mamagement

==
1 - Wait on creating the template library. We will address that soon.

2 -Fix the issues. 

The current issues I am aware of (some might be redundant):

2.1 - Address pre-existing StackCodeValidator test failures
2.2 - Review and update CLI parser tests
2.3 - Deprecate {{...}} syntax in favor of ${...} for consistency
2.4 - Fix 12 test failures in stack_code_validator
2.5 - Fix CLI test import errors

Add any other issue you know.

Solve all issues.

Run ALL tests again.

==
3 - Create new docs:

   - Error_Handling_Guide_v4.1.md
   - Implementation_Examples_v4.1.md

   - Enhanced_Template_Format_Specification.4.1.md
   - Auto_Extraction_System_Guide.4.1.md

# Tasks

   - Adapt network stack to confirm with architecture v.4(.*)

## Task 1 - READ CONTEXT

   Read ALL of the documents below, one more time:

    - cloud/tools/docs/Multi_Stack_Architecture.4.1.md
    - cloud/tools/docs/Multi_Stack_Architecture_4.1_Update_Specification.md

    - cloud/tools/docs/Directory_Structure_Diagram.4.1.md
    - cloud/tools/docs/Deployment_Manifest_Specification.4.1.md

    - cloud/tools/docs/Stack_Parameters_and_Registration_Guide_v4.md
    - cloud/tools/docs/Complete_Guide_Templates_Stacks_Config_and_Registration_v4.md
    - cloud/tools/docs/Complete_Stack_Management_Guide_v4.md

    - cloud/tools/docs/README.md
    - cloud/tools/docs/INSTALL.md
    - cloud/tools/docs/INSTALL_v4.1_additions.md

   - cloud/tools/docs/API_Reference_v4.1.md
   - cloud/tools/docs/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE_v4.1.md

## Task 2 - READ NETWORK STACK

   - Read all of the files and code inside the current network stack (cloud/stacks/network/).

   - Understand its intended functionality and the implemented functionality.

## Task 3 - THINK

   3.1 - Think and Plan what needs to be changed in the stack files and code, to become fully complient with architecture v.4.1.

   3.2 - Analyze (non-exclusively) the following:

      - directory structures
      - naming conventions
      - stack structure
      - stack registration
      - template management
      - deployment management 
      - pulumi state management
      - cross-stack dependencies

## Task 4 - IMPLEMENT

   4.1 - Generate complete new files and code to replace the old, network stack implementation.

   4.2 - Ensure that the new code:

         - Matches v.4.1 architecture.
         - Will create the intended AWS resources, when the code is ran via the "cloud" CLI tool.
         - Will generated the expected output, when the code is ran via the "cloud" CLI tool.

## Task 5 - REGISTER

   - Register the new "network" stack.

## Task 6 - PREPARE

   Create a "live", test deployment with:
      - Only "network" stack enabled.
      - Only "dev" environment enabled.

## Task 7 - EXECUTE

   - Execute the live test deployment.

   - Verify the planned AWS resources were created.

## Task 8 - REPORT

   - Write a short report document.

==
Before you proceed i want you to verify something:

I think the Multi_Stack_Architecture.4.1.md:1281-1293 document is wrong, regarding the stack directory structure.

1 - Check:

    - cloud/tools/docs/Directory_Structure_Diagram.4.1.md
    - cloud/tools/docs/Complete_Stack_Management_Guide_v4.md

2 - Correct Multi_Stack_Architecture.4.1.md

After that verification and possible correction, you may proceed with the Implementation, and generate the v4.1-compliant network stack code and enhanced template as planned; with the necessary adjustments (to comply with the authoritative Directory_Structure_Diagram.4.1.md), if necessary.

==
# Tasks

## Task 1

   - Did you use the CLI tool to create the deplyment and deploy? if NO, explain why. 

## Task 2 

   - Can you use the cli tool to destroy all of the aws resources created in the live test deplyment? Execute and confirm those resources (and ONLY those resources) were destroyed

## Task 3 

   - Then, do another live test deployment, for the network stack, using the CLI tool to create the deployment and to actually deply it and check its status.

## Task 4 

   - Lastly, to run the CLI tool, do we invoke it by calling "cloud" or "cloud_cli"? We want just "cloud"; what needs to be changed in the implementation and possibly, documents?

## Task 5 

   - Save the whole reposnse from the tasks above, under a new report document - for Test 2 of Network Stack - v.4.1. 
   
   - Lets start saving all of the execution report documents and version them.

==

Make a plan and save it as a markdown document(maybe to be executed in a new session - so include references to contextual document), to implement all of the Recommendations from the Network_Stack_Test_2_Report_v4.1.md document (Exerpt below). Execute the plan after its documented.

   <snippet>
      ## Recommendations

      ### Immediate (Critical)

      1. **Audit All CLI Commands**
         - Check every command file for same issues
         - Verify method names match core library
         - Verify parameter signatures
         - Verify return type handling

      2. **Add Integration Tests**
         - Create `tests/integration/` suite
         - Test CLI → Core method calls
         - Mock Pulumi/AWS for speed
         - Run in CI/CD

      3. **CLI Smoke Tests**
         - Test each command help text
         - Test each command with dry-run
         - Verify manifest validation
         - Verify error handling

      ### Short-term (Important)

      4. **Update Documentation**
         - Document actual CLI command usage
         - Show installation process
         - Update examples with `cloud` command
         - Document v4.1 manifest format in CLI docs

      5. **Version Alignment**
         - Ensure CLI docs reference v4.1
         - Remove v3.1 references
         - Update CLI help text versions

      ### Long-term (Quality)

      6. **Type Checking**
         - Enable mypy for CLI commands
         - Add type hints to all functions
         - CI/CD type check enforcement

      7. **API Contracts**
         - Define interfaces for core library
         - Use protocols/abstract classes
         - Detect breaking changes automatically

===

1 - Implement the following Recommendations from CLI_Audit_Report_v4.1.md:

   <recommendatiions>
      ### Immediate (Critical)
      1. ✅ Complete audit of all 13 commands (DONE)
      2. ⏳ Fix deploy_cmd.py (5 issues)
      3. ⏳ Fix destroy_cmd.py (1 issue)
      4. ⏳ Test fixes with preview/dry-run modes
      5. ⏳ Full integration test

      ### Short-term (Important)
      6. Add smoke tests for all 13 commands
      7. Add integration tests for deploy/destroy workflows
      8. Document correct API usage patterns
      9. Add pre-commit hooks for API signature validation
   </recommendatiions>

2 - Implement Phases 1, 2 and 3 of from CLI_v4.1_Integration_Fix_Plan.md

==
## Installation

```bash
# Install from source
cd cloud/tools/cli
pip install -e .

# Verify installation
cloud --version  # Should show 4.1.x
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Initialize deployment
cloud init --template fullstack

# Deploy a single stack
cloud deploy-stack DTEST01 network --environment dev

# Check status
cloud status DTEST01 --environment dev

# Destroy stack
cloud destroy-stack DTEST01 network --environment dev --yes
```

==
# Question 1: Which templates you needed but could not find and had to create?

# Question 2: Isn't the Deplyment ID automaticly generated if not passed to the "cloud init" command?

# Question 3:
   why are you using the following command:
      "python -m cloud_cli.main status status DTEST01 --environment dev"
   instead of something like:
      "cloud status DTEST01 --environment dev"

# Tasks 

Proceed with Remaining Work - immediately

## Task 1 - **cloud_core Investigation Needed**
   - Why does DeploymentManager return None?
   - Path discovery mechanism needs review
   - Configuration/environment setup required

## Task 2 - **Full Integration Test Blocked**
   - Cannot test actual deployment flow
   - Cannot test destroy workflow
   - Requires cloud_core fix first

==
```bash
cd cloud/tools/cli
python -m cloud_cli.main deploy-stack deploy-stack DTEST02 network --environment dev --preview
```

python -m cloud_cli.main status status DTEST01 --environment dev

Bash(cd cloud && python -m cloud_cli.main init init --org CLITestOrg --project        
      cli-live-test --domain clitest.example.com --account-dev 123456789012 --template  
      defau…)
  ⎿  Generated deployment ID: DWXE7BR

==
1 - if you needed to update the pulumiOrg to andre-2112, then you should ensure any template that has been set to pulumiOrg is fixed.

2 - no live-test-5 and 2 live-test-6? why? how did that happen? explain and if necessary, fix.

3 - i saw in deplyment logs the following: "pulumi stack rm andre-2112/network/DWXE7BR-network-dev"

3.1 - is that how the architecture defined the pulumi stack names?

3.2 - show me the section in the architecture documents , that talk about the pulumi stack naming.

4 - why "cloud list" is showing 4 deployments as initialized and not "deployed"?

==
1 - save the status explanation to a short new addendum document under the current arch version.

2 - regarding the pulumi stack name, the implemented code *might* be wrong (but could be right too).
i remember seeing in the documentation, the naming convention we had chosen.
during the discussions about org names, porject names at deplyment level and pulumi stack level.
look at the arch v.3.1 doc or stack configuration and management docs for v3.1 and v4.
search every doc in the tools/docs if necessary.

==

1 - destroy all current deployments. wait until all related aws resources are cleaned up.

2 - delete all deployment directories (under cloud/deploy). we will start fresh.

3 - fix the code related to the pulumi naming convention - make it conform wiht the planned architecture.

4 - create a new live test deployment - for network stack, for dev environment. live-test-1. deploy it using the cli.

==
Option 3. dynamically generate pulumi.yaml. the other options are really not      
  good. but make a detailed implementation plan first and document it -      
  including the dynamic Pulumi.yaml logic. add the last response to the      
  document, documenting the reasons for the dynamic pulumi.yaml. then        
  execute the implementation plan. set organization for all tests
  (template) to "TestOrg" and the project to "TestProj". then make 2 test    
  deployments.  

==
1 - Disable all stacks, by default, in the templates.

2 - Add the dynamic Pulumi.yaml solution to the authoritative Architecture documents (whenever its related to the document), creating new documents, complete from v4 or 4.1 (do not remove document sections - only adjust or add); but use version 4.5 now. The new architecture version will be known as Architecture 4.5 (or just Arch.4.5).

==
cloud config for pulumi and aws credentials
how to use temporary crednetials for both?
sync local state with remote pulumi - for new cli users
multiple pulumi yaml inside the stacks???
Option 3: create pulumi.yaml in the deployment dir and cp to stack dir during deployment.



==
1 - add architecture and implementation support, for aws tags for organization, project, deployment id, stack and environment; for every and all aws resources created. identify all of the aws resources cannot be tagged.

2 - propose to add a feature to enable "cloud init" to interactively ask about the organization name, as well as project name, to overide the defaults file.  perhaps a new "cloud config" command should help set these values, that should be stored in the default tmeplate or some config file.

==
1 - why did we get that deploy_stack_command error? i want no errors!

2 - why are you doing a PATH export every time? cant this cloud path execution issues be dealt with at the beginning of the install and be done with it - only invoke the cloud command and that is all? whatever the sulution, we also need to umdate the INSTALL document for that - have we done that already?

3 - if you find errors, dont destroy the deployment - use it to investigate and fix the root of the issue.

4 - after you answer the questions (and possibly make any corrections), do another test deployment, only for the network stack on dev environment - hopefully wiht no errors. do not destroy the deployment after the test. i will want ot use the cloud status command later, to check on the deployment.

==
The INSTALL.md is already updated (lines 417-486)

1 - Fix the Unicode error once and for all: Replace Unicode characters with ASCII equivalents or handle
  UnicodeEncodeError gracefully.

2 - Proactively think and fix similar unicode issues in other cloud commands that already have been implemented.

3 - Is "cd cloud" required? i would like to type the "cloud" command from any directory.  
  deploy a 5th deplyment - for network stack only and for dev environment. i want to    
  see 2 concurrent deployments with cloud status.

4 - And why "cloud init init" and "cloud status status"? why the repetition?

==
OMG: cloud init / cloud list / cloud status / cloud destroy

1 - What do you mean register commands? what kind of command registration? is it necessary or are there other alternatives? we should be able to just run "cloud" from any directory - but the installation should be as simp;le as possible and work on any OS (mac/linux, windows).

2 - cloud status - it says: Erro: missing command. why?

==
1 - Make sure the following below is applied to all commands - i dont want unicode errors on other cloud commands. And fix the any and all template path issues. then test some other command to see if unicode issues are still present (pick a command that would encounter the unicode issue). then, run another concurrent deployment as yet another deplyment test.

<exerpt>
"cd cloud" Requirement Removed

  Created cloud/tools/cli/src/cloud_cli/utils/path_utils.py      
  with:
  - find_cloud_root() - Searches for cloud directory
  automatically
  - get_stacks_dir(), get_deploy_dir(), get_tools_dir()
  helpers

  Applied to: deploy_stack_cmd.py and destroy_stack_cmd.py       
  (line 110 & 102 respectively)

  Now works from ANY directory (tested from /tmp)

  Note: Template paths still need fixing (TemplateManager        
  uses Path.cwd()) - this is tracked for future work but
  doesn't block normal operations.
</exerpt>

==
Deployment directories should remain even after resources have been destroyed.
How to flag fully destroyed or partially destroyed?

Add deplyment preservation policy to Architecture docs

  📋 Deployment Status Values (Defined)

  - initialized - Created but never deployed
  - deploying - Deployment in progress
  - deployed - Active with resources
  - deploy_failed - Deployment attempt failed
  - destroying - Destroy in progress
  - destroyed - Resources removed but history preserved ✅
  - destroy_failed - Destroy attempt failed
  - archived - Manually marked as archived

  🎯 Policy Benefits

  1. Audit Trail - Complete history of all deployments
  2. Compliance - Never lose deployment records
  3. Debugging - Review past deployments and failures
  4. Metrics - Track deployment patterns and costs
  5. Documentation - Built-in deployment notes field

  The cloud list list command now correctly shows the destroyed status, preserving      
  the deployment history while clearly indicating it's no longer active! 🎉
