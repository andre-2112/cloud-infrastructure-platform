# Compute EC2 Stack (compute-ec2) - Execution History

## Session Overview
**Date:** 2025-09-25 (Continuation)
**Execution Status:**  Completed Successfully
**Generated Files:** 1 (index.ts)
**Dependencies:** network (20), security (30), dns (10), storage (60)

## Execution Timeline

### 1. Requirements Analysis (Completed)
-  Analyzed Stack_Resources.md - 45 AWS resources for EC2 compute infrastructure
-  Analyzed Stack_Definitions.md - Launch templates, Auto Scaling, ALB configuration
-  Analyzed Stack_Prompt_Main.md - EC2 compute infrastructure requirements

### 2. Architecture Planning (Completed)
-  Planned launch templates for web and worker servers
-  Designed Auto Scaling Groups with environment-aware scaling
-  Planned Application Load Balancer with HTTPS termination
-  Designed CloudWatch monitoring and auto-scaling policies
-  Planned IAM roles and security group configurations

### 3. Code Generation (Completed)
-  Generated complete Pulumi TypeScript implementation
-  Created launch templates with CloudWatch agent and Node.js runtime
-  Implemented Auto Scaling Groups with multi-AZ deployment
-  Set up Application Load Balancer with SSL termination
-  Configured target groups with health checks
-  Created IAM roles and instance profiles
-  Implemented CloudWatch monitoring and alarms
-  Integrated with centralized state management system

### 4. Key Features Implemented
- **Launch Templates**: Web and worker server templates with automated software installation
- **Auto Scaling**: CPU-based scaling with environment-aware configurations
- **Load Balancer**: Internet-facing ALB with HTTPS termination and health checks
- **Security**: Encrypted EBS volumes, security groups, IAM roles with least-privilege
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch metrics, alarms, and log aggregation
- **DNS Integration**: Route53 records for domain routing

### 5. Outputs Generated
```typescript
export const webAsgName = webServerAsg.name;
export const workerAsgName = workerServerAsg.name;
export const albDnsName = applicationLoadBalancer.dnsName;
export const albArn = applicationLoadBalancer.arn;
export const albZoneId = applicationLoadBalancer.zoneId;
export const webTargetGroupArn = webTargetGroup.arn;
export const webServerRoleArn = webServerRole.arn;
export const workerServerRoleArn = workerServerRole.arn;
export const keyPairName = mainKeyPair.keyName;
```

## Final Status:  COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

The Compute EC2 stack has been successfully generated with comprehensive EC2-based infrastructure including Auto Scaling Groups, Application Load Balancer, monitoring, and security features. Ready for deployment as traditional compute infrastructure alongside containerized workloads.
