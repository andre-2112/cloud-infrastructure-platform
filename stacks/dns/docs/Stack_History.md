# DNS Stack (dns) - Execution History

## Session Overview
**Date:** 2025-09-25
**Execution Status:**  Completed Successfully
**Generated Files:** 1 (index.ts)
**Dependencies:** None (Foundation Stack)

## Execution Timeline

### 1. Requirements Analysis (Completed)
-  Analyzed Stack_Definitions.md - DNS management with Route53 and SSL certificates
-  Analyzed Stack_Resources.md - 16 AWS resources for DNS and certificate management
-  Analyzed Stack_Prompt_Main.md - Domain architecture and health monitoring requirements

### 2. Architecture Planning (Completed)
-  Planned Route53 hosted zone creation for primary domain
-  Designed SSL certificate provisioning (primary and wildcard)
-  Planned DNS validation and health check implementation
-  Defined domain structure: apex, www, api, cdn subdomains

### 3. Code Generation (Completed)
-  Generated complete Pulumi TypeScript implementation
-  Created hosted zone with proper DNS configuration
-  Implemented primary and wildcard SSL certificates with DNS validation
-  Added health checks for primary domain and API endpoint
-  Integrated with shared utilities for consistent naming and tagging

### 4. Key Features Implemented
- **Route53 Hosted Zone:** Primary domain management with delegation
- **SSL Certificates:** Primary domain and wildcard certificates with DNS validation
- **Health Monitoring:** HTTP/HTTPS health checks for critical endpoints
- **Security:** Proper certificate validation and DNS record management
- **Integration:** Centralized state management and resource tagging

### 5. Outputs Generated
```typescript
export const hostedZoneId = hostedZone.zoneId;
export const domainName = deploymentConfig.deployDomain;
export const primaryCertificateArn = primaryCertificateValidation.certificateArn;
export const wildcardCertificateArn = wildcardCertificateValidation.certificateArn;
export const primaryHealthCheckId = primaryHealthCheck.id;
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Dependencies Resolved
- **No dependencies** - This is a foundation stack
- Uses only `centralState.getDeploymentConfig()` for deployment variables

### Resource Configuration
- **Hosted Zone:** Configured for the primary deployment domain
- **Certificates:** Both primary and wildcard with automatic DNS validation
- **Health Checks:** HTTPS monitoring on port 443 with custom resource paths
- **DNS Records:** Validation records automatically created and managed

### State Management
- Integrated with centralized state system
- Consistent resource naming using `createResourceName()`
- Comprehensive tagging with `createResourceTags()`
- All outputs properly exported for dependent stacks

## Final Status:  COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

The DNS stack has been successfully generated and is ready for deployment. All infrastructure components are properly configured with security best practices.
