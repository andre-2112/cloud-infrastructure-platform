# Session 1 Prompt - Architecture 3.0 Documentation Generation

**Session Type:** Planning & Documentation
**Target:** Complete Tasks 1-4 from Prompt-12
**Status:** Ready for Execution
**Expected Duration:** Full session (~100-125K tokens)

---

## Context & Background

This is **Session 1 of 3** in a multi-session implementation strategy for Multi-Stack Architecture 3.0 (cloud-0.7 platform).

### Why This Session Exists

The full implementation (Prompt-12) exceeds Claude Code's 200K token limit. We've split it into:
- **Session 1 (THIS):** Planning & All Documentation (~110-125K tokens)
- **Session 2:** Core Implementation (~80-100K tokens)
- **Session 3:** Advanced Features (~60-80K tokens)

### What This Session Must Accomplish

**Primary Goal:** Generate complete Architecture 3.0 documentation set (15+ documents)

**Deliverables:**
1. Architecture 3.0 main document
2. 7 additional reference documents (CLI, REST, etc.)
3. 7 addendum documents
4. Ready-to-implement specifications

---

## Pre-Session Reading (CRITICAL)

   - Focus on Tasks 1-4 (ignore Task 5 for this session)

2. **./admin/v2/docs/Multi_Stack_Architecture.2.3.md**
   - Current architecture (version 2.3)
   - This is the base to build upon
   - All features must be preserved in 3.0

3. **./admin/v2/docs/Prompt-11 - Pre-Implementation - Responses.md**
   - Answers to pre-implementation questions
   - Contains critical architecture decisions
   - Integration points for version 3.0

4. **./admin/v2/docs/Execution_Feasibility_Analysis.md**
   - Multi-session strategy explanation
   - Token budget analysis
   - Context for this session

5. **./admin/v2/docs/CLI_Commands_Reference.2.3.md**

## Execution Instructions

### Step 1: Planning Phase

1. Read all required documents (listed above)
2. Create mental model of Architecture 3.0
3. Identify all changes from 2.3 to 3.0
4. Plan document generation order
5. **DO NOT START GENERATING** until planning is complete

### Step 2: Document Generation Order

**Recommended sequence:**

1. **Changes Addendum** (understand what changed)
2. **Main Architecture 3.0** (foundation document)
3. **CLI Documents** (3 docs: full, testing, quick)
4. **REST API Documents** (3 docs: full, testing, quick)
5. **Deployment Manifest Spec**
6. **Remaining Addendums** (6 docs: verification, cloning, code, monitoring, stats, Q&A)

### Step 3: Document Creation Guidelines

**For Each Document:**

1. **Start with version 2.3 equivalent** (if exists)
2. **Apply all Task 2 changes systematically:**
   - Update all "multi-stack" → "cloud"
   - Update all "staging" → "stage"
   - Update all directory paths
   - Update all stack naming conventions
3. **Add new content from Pre-Implementation Responses:**
   - Stack dependencies in templates
   - Smart deployment features
   - Layer management details
   - Progress monitoring details
4. **Remove code from main docs** (move to code addendum)
5. **Update all cross-references** between documents
6. **Verify completeness** against Arch 2.3

### Step 4: Quality Checks

**Before Completing:**

- ✅ All 15 documents generated
- ✅ All "multi-stack" → "cloud" conversions done
- ✅ All "staging" → "stage" conversions done
- ✅ All directory paths updated
- ✅ All cross-references valid
- ✅ No code in main architecture doc
- ✅ All diagrams updated
- ✅ All features from 2.3 preserved
- ✅ All improvements from Pre-Implementation included

## Token Budget Monitoring

**Expected Usage:**
- Task 1 (Reading): ~10-15K tokens
- Task 2-3 (Planning): ~5-10K tokens

**If approaching 180K tokens:**
- Stop document generation
- Save progress
- Note what remains
- Continue in new session if needed

**Current token budget:**
- Started: ~93K used
- Remaining: ~107K
- Target: Complete all 15 docs within budget

---

## Emergency Recovery

**If session crashes or VSCode restarts:**

1. Check what was completed:
   ```bash
   ls -la ./admin/v2/docs/ | grep "3.0.md"
   ```

2. Review completed documents

3. Continue from last incomplete document

4. Use this prompt to resume

5. Reference completed work
