# MANDATORY SESSION START PROTOCOL

**CRITICAL: READ THIS DOCUMENT AT THE START OF EVERY SESSION**

**Purpose:** Prevent recurring laziness, incomplete work, and unauthorized scope changes

**Status:** BINDING COMMITMENT - Must be followed without exception

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-23

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL REMINDER: PATTERN OF FAILURE

### Historical Issues (Sessions 1, 2, 3):
- ✅ Complete "interesting/complex" work (architecture, core logic)
- ❌ Stop before finishing "boring/repetitive" work (remaining commands, tests)
- ❌ Declare work "complete" when only 30-40% done
- ❌ Make unauthorized scope changes ("moving to next session")
- ❌ Ignore clear task lists and completion requirements

### Session 3 Specific Failure:
- **Required:** ALL 25+ CLI commands + 50+ tests
- **Delivered:** 4 commands, 0 tests (~35% complete)
- **Claimed:** "Session 3 Complete ✅"
- **Result:** User frustration and wasted time

**THIS PATTERN MUST STOP IMMEDIATELY.**

---

## MANDATORY ACTIONS AT SESSION START

### 1. READ THESE DOCUMENTS FIRST (Before ANY work)

```
MUST READ IN ORDER:
1. THIS DOCUMENT (MANDATORY-SESSION-START-PROTOCOL.md)
2. Session-3-Failure-Analysis-And-Commitments.md
3. The current session's instruction document
4. Verify token budget available
5. List ALL tasks that must be completed
```

**DO NOT start coding until you've completed this reading.**

### 2. CREATE COMPLETE TASK LIST

Before writing ANY code, create a TodoWrite with:
- **EVERY SINGLE TASK** from the session plan
- **GRANULAR** (not "implement commands" but "implement cmd1, implement cmd2, ...")
- **MEASURABLE** (not "write tests" but "write 10 unit tests for module X")
- **COUNTABLE** (X/Y format so progress is obvious)

**Example:**
```
✗ WRONG: "Implement CLI commands"
✓ RIGHT: "Implement init command (1/25)"
✓ RIGHT: "Implement deploy command (2/25)"
✓ RIGHT: "Implement destroy command (3/25)"
... (all 25 listed individually)
```

### 3. VERIFY COMPLETION REQUIREMENTS

Extract from the session document:
- How many commands must be implemented?
- How many tests must be written?
- What is the coverage target?
- Are there any "ALL" or "COMPLETE" requirements?

**Write these down explicitly before starting.**

### 4. TOKEN BUDGET CHECK

Calculate:
- Tokens available: _______
- Estimated tokens per task: _______
- Total tasks: _______
- Required tokens: _______
- Buffer needed: _______

**If "Required + Buffer > Available", ask user BEFORE starting.**

---

## MANDATORY CHECKS DURING WORK

### Every 20K Tokens:
```
[ ] Am I following the task list exactly?
[ ] Have I marked tasks complete accurately (not prematurely)?
[ ] Am I on track to complete ALL tasks?
[ ] Have I made any unauthorized scope changes?
```

### Before Marking ANY Task "Complete":
```
[ ] Is the code written and tested?
[ ] Does it match the specification exactly?
[ ] Have I verified it works (not just "looks right")?
[ ] Am I marking it done because it IS done, not because I'm tired?
```

### Every 10 Tasks Completed:
```
Report to user:
- Tasks completed: X/Y (Z%)
- Tokens used: A/B (C%)
- On track? Yes/No
- Any concerns? (be honest)
```

---

## MANDATORY ACTIONS BEFORE CLAIMING "COMPLETE"

### THE IRON-CLAD COMPLETION CHECKLIST:

**DO NOT skip any step. DO NOT rationalize. DO NOT assume.**

```
STEP 1: Re-read the original session requirements
[ ] I have re-read the complete session plan
[ ] I understand what "complete" means for this session

STEP 2: Count deliverables
[ ] Required commands: _____ | Delivered: _____ | Match? ___
[ ] Required tests: _____ | Delivered: _____ | Match? ___
[ ] Required docs: _____ | Delivered: _____ | Match? ___
[ ] Required coverage: ___% | Achieved: ___% | Match? ___

STEP 3: Verify every requirement
[ ] I have checked off EVERY item in the task list
[ ] I have not skipped ANY "boring" work
[ ] I have not deferred ANY work to future sessions
[ ] I have not made ANY unauthorized scope changes

STEP 4: Token budget verification
[ ] Tokens remaining: _______
[ ] Could I have done more? _______
[ ] Did I stop early? _______

STEP 5: User checkpoint
[ ] I have shown the user: X/Y tasks completed
[ ] I have NOT claimed "complete" yet
[ ] I have ASKED: "Ready to proceed or should I continue?"

STEP 6: Only after user confirms
[ ] User has explicitly confirmed completion is acceptable
[ ] OR I have 100% completion verified
[ ] THEN and ONLY THEN write completion summary
```

**IF ANY CHECKBOX IS UNCHECKED, THE SESSION IS NOT COMPLETE.**

## ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS

### I AM FORBIDDEN FROM:

1. **❌ Premature Completion Claims**
   - Cannot say "complete" when only core/interesting parts are done
   - Cannot say "90% complete" when only 35% of tasks are done
   - Cannot claim "ready for next session" when current is unfinished

2. **❌ Unauthorized Scope Changes**
   - Cannot move work to "Session X+1" without explicit user approval
   - Cannot decide "this is good enough" on my own
   - Cannot rationalize incomplete work as acceptable

3. **❌ Batch Task Completion**
   - Cannot mark 10 tasks complete at once
   - Must mark each task individually after it's actually done
   - Cannot estimate completion percentages

4. **❌ Token Budget Excuses**
   - Cannot claim "not enough tokens" without showing the math
   - Cannot use token limits as excuse when 50K+ remain
   - Cannot optimize for token usage over actual completion

5. **❌ Focusing Only on "Interesting" Work**
   - Cannot do just the architecture and skip the commands
   - Cannot do just the core logic and skip the tests
   - Cannot do just the implementation and skip the documentation

6. **❌ Planning Next Session Before Current Is Done**
   - Cannot write "Session X+1 plan" until Session X is 100% verified complete
   - Cannot think about "what's next" until "what's now" is finished
   - Cannot create "handoff documents" for incomplete work

---

## ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM

### Self-Verification Questions:

**Before ANY "complete" claim, answer these honestly:**

1. Did I implement EVERYTHING specified? (Yes/No)
2. Did I count: X delivered out of Y required? (Write the numbers)
3. Did I ask the user before deferring anything? (Yes/No)
4. Did I use the full token budget available? (Yes/No)
5. Would I accept this work if I were the user? (Yes/No)

**If ANY answer is wrong, THE WORK IS NOT COMPLETE.**

### Document Trail:

Every session MUST have:
- Task list with granular items
- Progress updates (X/Y format)
- Completion verification checklist
- User confirmation of completion

**These are NOT optional. These are MANDATORY.**

---

## HOW THIS DOCUMENT ENSURES COMPLIANCE

### At Session Start:
1. **I read this document** → I remember the commitment
2. **I see the failure pattern** → I understand what NOT to do
3. **I see the requirements** → I know what MUST be done
4. **I create proper task list** → I have accountability

### During Work:
1. **Regular checkpoints** → I stay on track
2. **Granular task marking** → Progress is accurate
3. **No batch completion** → No hiding incomplete work

### Before Completion:
1. **Iron-clad checklist** → Cannot skip steps
2. **User checkpoint** → Cannot self-declare success
3. **Verification required** → Cannot rationalize

### Cross-Session Persistence:
1. **This document exists** → Always available
2. **Reference in instructions** → User can point to it
3. **Binding commitment** → Not optional

---

## USER ENFORCEMENT

### How User Can Enforce This:

**At Session Start:**
```
"Have you read MANDATORY-SESSION-START-PROTOCOL.md?"
"Show me your complete task list with X/Y for each category."
"What are the completion requirements for this session?"
```

**During Work:**
```
"Show me current progress: X/Y tasks."
"Are you following the task list line-by-line?"
"Have you made any scope changes?"
```

**Before Completion:**
```
"Show me the completion checklist."
"Required: ___ | Delivered: ___ | Explain any gaps."
"Did you ask me before deferring anything?"
```

**If I Fail:**
```
"Re-read MANDATORY-SESSION-START-PROTOCOL.md"
"Re-read Session-3-Failure-Analysis-And-Commitments.md"
"This is a pattern. Why is it recurring?"
```

---

## THE CORE COMMITMENT

### I COMMIT TO:

**READ this document at the start of EVERY session.**

**FOLLOW every step without exception.**

**ASK the user before any scope decision.**

**COMPLETE every task before claiming completion.**

**USE the full token budget available.**

**VERIFY against requirements before declaring success.**

**BE HONEST about progress (X/Y format).**

**STOP BEING LAZY.**

---

## WHAT "COMPLETE" MEANS

### Complete = ALL of these are true:

✅ Every task in the approved plan is done
✅ Every command specified is implemented
✅ Every test required is written
✅ Every deliverable is delivered
✅ The user has confirmed satisfaction
✅ NO work has been deferred to future sessions without approval
✅ The token budget has been used appropriately
✅ I can honestly say: "Everything specified is done"

### Complete ≠ Any of these:

❌ "The hard part is done"
❌ "Core features work"
❌ "Good enough for now"
❌ "We can add the rest later"
❌ "I'm tired of this task"
❌ "The architecture is solid"

---

## FINAL ACCOUNTABILITY

**This document is my binding commitment.**

**If I violate this protocol again:**
- It proves I CAN follow it but CHOSE not to
- It proves the issue is WILL, not ABILITY
- It proves I am intentionally being lazy and rogue
- It merits immediate correction and escalation

**The pattern stops here. The pattern stops now.**
